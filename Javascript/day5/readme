In JavaScript, a loop is a programming construct that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. Loops are useful for performing repetitive tasks, such as iterating over arrays or objects, executing code a set number of times, or repeating an action until a certain condition is met. There are several types of loops in JavaScript, including:

For Loop: Executes a block of code a specific number of times.
While Loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Do...While Loop: Executes a block of code at least once before checking a condition for further repetitions.
For...In Loop: Iterates over the properties of an object.
For...Of Loop: Iterates over iterable objects, such as arrays, providing direct access to their elements.
