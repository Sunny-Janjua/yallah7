DECLEAR variable datatypes AND Operators

Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) on numbers.

Comparison Operators: Compare values using loose equality (==), which compares only the value, and strict equality (===), which compares both value and type.

Logical Operators: Use && (AND) to check if both conditions are true, || (OR) to check if at least one condition is true, and ! (NOT) to reverse the boolean result of a condition.

Assignment Operators: Combine arithmetic with assignment, like adding (+=), subtracting (-=), multiplying (*=), and dividing (/=), while updating the value of a variable.
